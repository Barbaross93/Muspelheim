##  Commands
## ==========


#  Setting a variable
# --------------------
#
# syntax: set <option> = <value>
# 
# See below for the list of available variables.


#  Defining a new custom field
# -----------------------------
#
# syntax: field <identifier> = <human readable name> [ , <type> ]
#
# with <type> being one of 'string' (default), 'emails', 'list', or 'date'
#
# Example of field definitions:
field pager = Pager
field address_lines = Address, list
field birthday = Birthday, date


#  Defining a view/tab
# ---------------------
#
# view <view name> = <field1> [ , <field2>, ... ]
#
# with <fieldN> being the identifier of a field declared with the 'field'
# command, or the identifier of a standard field.
#
# Standard fields:
#    name, email,
#    address, address2, city, state, zip, country,
#    phone, workphone, fax, mobile,
#    nick, url, notes, anniversary
#
# Note: if you don't define any view, abook will use a default display based
#       on the above standard fields.
#
# Example of views:
view CONTACT = name, email
view ADDRESS = address_lines, city, state, zip, country
view PHONE = phone, workphone, pager, mobile, fax
view OTHER = url, birthday
