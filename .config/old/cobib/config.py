"""An example configuration for coBib.

Since version 3.0 coBib is configured through a Python file.
For documentation purposes this example configuration lists all possible settings with their default
values and detailed explanations.

Internally, coBib's configuration is nothing but a (nested) Python dictionary. However, for ease of
usage all of its fields are also exposed as attributes. This means, that the following two lines are
equivalent:

```python
config['database']['git'] = True
config.database.git = True
```
"""

# Generally, you won't need these, but the default configuration relies on them.
import os
import sys

# To get started you must import coBib's configuration.
from cobib.config import config

# Now, you are all set to apply your own settings.


# LOGGING
# You can specify the default logfile location.
config.logging.logfile = "~/.cache/cobib/cobib.log"

# COMMANDS
# These settings affect some command specific behavior.

# You can specify the default bibtex entry type.
config.commands.edit.default_entry_type = "article"

# You can specify the editor program.
config.commands.edit.editor = os.environ.get("EDITOR", "vim")
# Note, that this default will respect your `$EDITOR` environment setting and fallback to `vim` if
# that variable is not set.

# You can specify a custom command which will be used to `open` files associated with your entries.
config.commands.open.command = "xdg-open" if sys.platform.lower() == "linux" else "open"

# You can specify a custom grep tool which will be used to search through your database and any
# associated files. The default tool (`grep`) will not provide results for attached PDFs but other
# tools such as [ripgrep-all](https://github.com/phiresky/ripgrep-all) will.
config.commands.search.grep = "grep"
# If you want to specify additional arguments for your grep command, you can specify them as a list
# of strings in the following setting. Note, that GNU's grep understands extended regex patterns
# even without specifying `-E`.
config.commands.search.grep_args = []

# You can specify whether searches should be performed case-insensitive.

# DATABASE
# These settings affect the database in general.

# You can specify the path to the database YAML file. You can use a `~` to represent your `$HOME`
# directory.
config.database.file = "~/.local/share/cobib/literature.yaml"

# coBib can integrate with `git` in order to automatically track the history of your database.
# However, by default, this option is disabled. If you want to enable it, simply change the
# following setting to `True` and initialize your database with `cobib init --git`.
# Warning: Before enabling this setting you must ensure that you have set up git properly by setting
# your name and email address.
config.database.git = False

# DATABASE.FORMAT
# You can also specify some aspects about the format of the database.

# You can specify whether latex warnings should not be ignored during the escaping of special
# characters. This is a simple option which gets passed on to the internally used `pylatexenc`
# library.
config.database.format.suppress_latex_warnings = True

# DATABASE.STRINGIFY
# You can customize the functions which convert non-string fields.

# Three fields are currently explicitly stored as lists internally. Upon conversion to the BibTeX
# format, these need to be converted to a basic string. In this process the entries of the list will
# be joined using the separators configured by the following settings.
config.database.stringify.list_separator.file = ", "
config.database.stringify.list_separator.tags = ", "
config.database.stringify.list_separator.url = ", "

# PARSERS
# These settings affect some parser specific behavior.

# You can specify whether the bibtex-parser should ignore non-standard bibtex entry types.
config.parsers.bibtex.ignore_non_standard_types = False


# TUI
# These settings affect the functionality and look of the TUI.

# You can specify a list of default arguments for the default list view.
config.tui.default_list_args = ["-l"]

# You can disable the prompt before quitting coBib by turning off the following setting:
config.tui.prompt_before_quit = False

# You can specify whether the list view of the TUI should be reversed. By default, this is enabled,
# because this will place the most recently added entries at the top of the TUI.
config.tui.reverse_order = True

# You can specify a scroll offset. This corresponds to the number of lines which will be kept
# visible above or below the cursor line while scrolling the buffer. If you set this number to
# something very large (e.g. 99) you can pin the cursor line to the center of the window during
# scrolling.
# Note: if you are a Vim user, this setting will feel similar to `scrolloff`.
config.tui.scroll_offset = 3

# TUI.COLORS
# With the following color settings you can change the look of the TUI. Each of these settings
# accepts any of the following color names: `black`, `red`, `green`, `yellow`, `blue`, `magenta`,
# `cyan` and `white`.
config.tui.colors.cursor_line_fg = "white"
config.tui.colors.cursor_line_bg = "cyan"

config.tui.colors.selection_bg = "magenta"

# Note: if your terminal supports it, you can even try to override the color specifications right
# from within coBib. The check whether your terminal supports this relies on the
# `curses.can_change_color()` function, which is more or less documented
# [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#curses.can_change_color).
# You can attempt to get this to work by overwriting the named colors with a `#RRGGBB` value like
# so:
#     config.tui.colors.black = `#222222`
# , which changes the black definition into a more mallow gray.

# TUI.KEY_BINDINGS
# You can also change the default key bindings of the TUI by overwriting any of the following
# settings with a different key.
config.tui.key_bindings.add = "a"
config.tui.key_bindings.delete = "d"
config.tui.key_bindings.edit = "e"

# Note, the exception of the key for `show` which is set to the custom `ENTER` string. When coBib
# encounters this string it will automatically map to the ASCII codes 10 and 13 (corresponding to
# the `line feed` and `carriage return`, respectively). Any other string is interpreted a single
# character whose ASCII value is used as the trigger.

# UTILS

# You can specify the default download location for associated files.

# You can provide rules to map from a journal's landing page URL to its PDF URL. To do so, you must
# insert an entry into the following dictionary, with a regex-pattern matching the journal's landing
# page URL and a value being the PDF URL. E.g.:
#
#     config.utils.file_downloader.url_map[
#         r"(.+)://aip.scitation.org/doi/([^/]+)"
#     ] = r"\1://aip.scitation.org/doi/pdf/\2"

#         r"(.+)://quantum-journal.org/papers/([^/]+)"
#     ] = r"\1://quantum-journal.org/papers/\2/pdf/"
#
# Make sure to use raw Python strings to ensure proper backslash-escaping.

# You can specify a list of journal abbreviations. This list should be formatted as tuples of the
# form: `(full journal name, abbreviation)`. The abbreviation should include any necessary
# punctuation which can be excluded upon export (see also `cobib export --help`).
