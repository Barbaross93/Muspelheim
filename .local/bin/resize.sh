# Resizes (expands or contracts) the selected node in the given
# direction.  This is assigned to a key binding in $HOME/.config/sxhkd/sxhkdrc

# NOTE by Protesilaos 2020-05-01: The support for floating windows was
# contributed by Pierre-Fran√ßois Bonnefoi who also recommends the
# following sxhkdrc config:
#
# super + ctrl + {Left,Down,Up,Right}
#     bspwm_resize {west,south,north,east} 50
